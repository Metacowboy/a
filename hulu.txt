This is the weak point of the script. The program doing the RAM dump is
dumper.exe; this program is weak in that it must kill the dumped process (in
this case Firefox) after it finishes. This creates a circular dependency: The
script shouldnt kill Firefox until the RtmpDump params are found, but you cant
know if they were found until after Firefox is killed.

The way I have tried to work around this problem is by monitoring the memory
usage of Firefox (/proc/$PID/maps) and basically guessing. When the memory usage
"flattens out" that is a good indicator that the video has been loaded.
