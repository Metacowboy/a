It should be noted that none of

* Flasm
* RabcDasm
* Flare

will [B]decompile[/B] SWF files. Flasm and RabcDasm will [B]disassemble[/B] swf
files into bytecode, but this is not ActionScript source code.

Flare claims to decompile but has not been updated since 2006 and does not work
on modern swf files.
