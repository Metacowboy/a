Its become clear that someone is censoring this forum.
The "unofficial" RtmpDump thread has been deleted several times.
The thread about DMCA was removed. Luckily I saved my post because I expected
this to happen.
If you remove it again, I will post it again. So you better go ahead and ban me,
or offer up a good explaination as to why this content is being removed.

It should be noted that none of

* Flasm
* RabcDasm
* Flare

will [B]decompile[/B] SWF files. Flasm and RabcDasm will [B]disassemble[/B] swf
files into bytecode, but this is not ActionScript source code.

Flare claims to decompile but has not been updated since 2006 and does not work
on modern swf files.
