[QUOTE=Howard Chu]You would not walk into the kitchen of a gourmet restaurant
and ask the head chef to teach you how to boil a pot of water. The question
itself is rude; it's inconsiderate of you to waste people's time with such
questions that you should have found the answer to long before.

Every thing that I put out on the web is the result of intense thought. I expect
the same of all of you. Think before you post.[/QUOTE]
