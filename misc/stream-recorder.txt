Xeebo filed a DMCA takedown notice on the svnpenn/rtmpdump repo, in order to
have the "Handshake 10" patch removed.

This has been done and a counter notice filed. The repository should be restored
in 10 days time. In mean time builds from "svnpenn" branch available upon
request.

In addition I filed a notice with Adobe about Xeeboâ€™s site
http://tubedigger.com, which is now down.

I tried to explain these event on this forum and moderator placebo banned me and
removed my thread. He even started removing my posts from other threads. I
believe the situation is now under control and all parties can move forward
amicably.
