It has become clear that someone is censoring this forum.
The "unofficial" RtmpDump thread has been deleted several times.
The thread about DMCA was removed. Luckily I saved my post because I expected
this to happen.
If you remove it again, I will post it again. So you better go ahead and ban me,
or offer up a good explaination as to why this content is being removed.
We have Xeebo to thank for this. He is the one who filed the DMCA takedown
notice with GitHub. Please feel free to email him at
[email]xeebosoft@ukr.net[/email]
with your concerns. For time being my build from master branch is here
[URL="rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/rtmpdump-v2.4-35-ge0056c5-master.7z"]
rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/rtmpdump-v2.4-35-ge0056c5-master.7z[/URL]
Builds from "svnpenn" branch are available upon request.
