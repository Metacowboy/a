In response to moderator placebo banning me and removing my posts/threads, I
have to say this.

My build on http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu has been pulled at my request. In
addition I will be pulling the builds on GitHub when the repo comes back up.
Those seeking Windows builds will need to use KSV, or build your own.

Finally this will be my last post on these forums until the current climate of
censorship and banning ceases. Further inquiries can be made to moderator
placebo.

Xeebo filed a DMCA takedown notice on the svnpenn/rtmpdump repo, in order to
have the "Handshake 10" patch removed.

This has been done and a counter notice filed. The repository should be restored
in 10 days time. In mean time build from "master" branch is here

[URL="rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/rtmpdump-v2.4-35-ge0056c5-master.7z"]
rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/rtmpdump-v2.4-35-ge0056c5-master.7z[/URL]

build from "svnpenn" branch available upon request.
In addition I filed a notice with Adobe about Xeeboâ€™s site
[url]http://tubedigger.com[/url], which is now down.

I tried to explain these event on this forum and moderator placebo banned me and
removed my thread. He even started removing my posts from other threads. I
believe the situation is now under control and all parties can move forward
amicably.
