RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that
provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries
(in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily
manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.
RubyGems is now part of the standard library from Ruby version 1.9.

### ~/.gemrc

# Show the dependencies of an installed gem
